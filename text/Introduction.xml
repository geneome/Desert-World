<div id="Introduction"><p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Desert World is a fork of Dungeon World and is a world of fantastic adventure. A world of magic, psionics, elementals, good and evil, and law and chaos. Brave heroes venture into the most dangerous corners of the land in search of gold and glory.</p>
<p>Adventurers take many shapes in Dungeon World. The races of elves, men, dwarves, half-giants, thri-kreen, muls, and halflings all have their heroes. Some are near-invincible beasts of battle encased in armor. Others are more mysterious, conjuring up and wielding the mighty forces of magic. Treasure and glory are sought by an elemental cleric, a tricky thief, a dangerous templar, and more.</p>
<p>It isn’t all easy heroics and noble bravery, though. Every time the ranger guides his friends through the desert wastes there are a hundred things waiting to bite his head off. Slavering hordes of gith, maybe. Or is this the forests of the Ringing Mountains, where dwells the feral half-ling tribes? Or the throngs of hateful dead, looking to drag a meaty corpse back to their lair? Scary, sure, but there’s treasure, too. More gold and jewels and magic lost to man have fallen between the cracks in the world than you can imagine. Who better to retrieve it than a band of stalwart heroes? </p>
<p>You and your friends <em>are</em> those heroes. You go where others can’t or won’t. There are monstrous things lurking in the world. Are you ready to face them?</p>
<h2>The Bard</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Everybody knows you’re a hired killer. When you show up at their gates with your smiles and your songs, they know that sometime not too long ago, some bastard handed you a bag full of ceramic and whispered a name in your ear, and before you take your leave the owner of that name will be dead. And yet somehow, every single time, they let you in anyways.</p>
<p>Yeah. You’re that good.</p>
<h2>The Cleric</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Maybe the gods loved Athas once. If so, that love wasn’t enough to save them from burning to dust and ash with the rest of this forsaken world. Where once you might have communed with a caring, benevolent deity, now you eke out divine power from one of the raw, primal elements of creation. Maybe you name it, try to ascribe a will and a desire to fire or water, earth or air. Maybe you sing its praises, but while it may come when you call it, you know one truth in your heart of hearts:</p>
<p>It does not love you.</p>
<h2>The Druid</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Athas is as pure a world as ever there was. Let the soft folk of the city-states cower under the yoke of the Sorcerer-Kings. Let the mad prophets babble about the kinder world that once was. You know the truth: Athas is nature unfettered, all the lies and hypocrisies of civilization laid bare like the throat of a defeated foe. You, druid, will be the teeth that close on that throat.</p>
<h2>The Fighter</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">It’s a thankless job—living day to day by your armor and the skill of your arm. To dive heedlessly into danger. They won’t be reciting tales about the time you took that knife to the ribs for them in that bar in Raam. No bards to sing of the time you dragged them, still screaming, from the edge of the Dead Land, no.</p>
<p>Forget them.</p>
<p>You do this for the guts and the glory. The scream of battle and the hot, hot blood of it. Your friends may carry blades of bone but, fighter, you are steel. While your traveling companions might moan about their wounds over a campfire in the wilderness, you bear your scars with pride.</p>
<p>You are the wall—let every danger smash itself to nothing on you. In the end, you’ll be the last one standing.</p>
<h2>The Gladiator</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">The roar of the crowd. The stink of sweat and blood and strange beasts out of the desert. The feel of your heart pounding like the ghost drums of Gulg. It’s a stark, brutal life, but at least it’s simple. Another dawn, another fight. Another dusk, another victory--or else no more dawns at all.</p>
<p>They may call you “slave,” but in your own way, you’re freer than all of them.</p>
<h2>The Psion</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Many choose to focus on a single aspect of themselves, specializing in physical, spiritual, or mental persuits. Even if they master one, they are still blind in the other two. You are a master of the Way, a nexus where the physical, spiritual, and mental meet.</p>
<p>The Psion sees the world as an extension of himself, where others see a dagger you see an extension of yourself, where others see a foe, you see a will to to command, where others see far, you see all places.</p>
<h2>The Templar</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Order can save Athas. Order and power. Your King knows that. The nobles know that. Even the rebels and heretics who call your King monster, name you toadie and slavemaster and worse, even they know it. Let them rail about freedom and equality and the overthrow of your King, when the Dragon is at the walls they will flock to you like frightened sheep. And if you have to cull some of them for the greater good, well... such is the duty of the shepherd.</p>
<h2>The Ranger</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You’ve seen the lives people lead in the city-states, safe behind walls that choke the life out of all in their shadows. That’s not for you. You’ve seen the lives people lead in the scattered villages, terrified of what the desert might bring. That’s not for you either. No, you’ll blaze your own trail, learn the secrets of the wastes and survive.</p>
<p>You are not the desert’s master. You are the desert. And no one can take that away from you.</p>
<h2>The Thief</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Power? Freedom? Fame? Joy? You know the one thing that can get you all of them in one go? Course you do. The clink of ceramic in your pocket, the sparkle of jewels in your vault. Money is the key to surviving Athas, and it’s all yours for the taking.</p>
<h2>The Wizard</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Magic wasn’t always like this. Once, they say, it was a wholesome power that made people’s lives easier, happier, longer. Now, though? It takes every scrap of willpower you have to not be a blight on the world. Magic hungers, and if you let it it will consume every last scrap of life on Athas. You should put it down and walk away, but it just keeps calling to you, whispering promises of what you could do if you just. Let. Go.</p>
<p>What would you let burn for power?</p></div>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Why play Dungeon World?</p>
<p>First, to see the characters do <strong>amazing things</strong>. To see them explore the unexplored, slay the undying, and go from the deepest bowels of the world to the highest peaks of the heavens. To see them caught up in momentous events and grand tragedies.</p>
<p>Second, to see them <strong>struggle together</strong>. To gather as a party despite their differences and stand united against their foes, or to argue over treasure, debate battle plans, and join in righteous celebration over a victory hard-won.</p>
<p>Third, because <strong>the world still has so many places to explore</strong>. There are unlooted tombs and dragon hoards dotting the countryside just waiting for quick-fingered and strong-armed adventurers to discover them. That unexplored world has plans of its own. Play to see what they are and how they’ll change the lives of our characters.</p>
<h1>How to Use This Book</h1>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">This book is going to teach you how to play Dungeon World. If you’re going to be the GM, you’re going to need to read the whole thing, though you can skim through the monster stats for now and save the Advanced Delving chapter for later. Try printing the play aids too, they’ll help you see what’s most important. If you’re a player, you might not need to read more than Playing the Game—a lot of the rules in Dungeon World will be contained in the character sheets you use during the game itself. You’ll come back to the text a few times throughout your game to refer to certain rules, but it should be a rare occasion.</p>
<h1>Setting Up</h1>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">To play Dungeon World, you’ll need to gather yourself and 2–5 friends. A group of 4 to 6, including you, is best. Choose one person to be the Game Master (GM). Everyone else will be players, taking the role of the characters in the game (we call these the player characters or PCs). As you play, the players say what their characters say, think, and do. The GM describes everything else in the world.</p>
<p>You can play a single session or string together multiple sessions into a campaign. Plan accordingly if you plan on playing a campaign, maybe setting aside a night of the week to play. Each session will usually be a few hours and you’ll be able to start playing right away within the first session.</p>
<p>You’ll need to print some materials. Before you start a new game, find or print off at least:</p>
<ul><li>A few copies of the basic and special moves</li>
<li>One copy of each class sheet</li>
<li>One copy each of the cleric and wizard spell sheets</li>
<li>One copy of the adventure sheet and GM moves</li>
<li>Miscellanea such as: pens and pencils, scrap paper for maps and notes, maybe some index cards</li></ul>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Everyone at the table will need something to write with and some six-sided dice. Two dice is the minimum but two dice per player is a good idea.</p>
<p>You’ll also need some specialized dice: four-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided and twelve-sided. One of each is enough but more is better: you won’t have to pass them around so much.</p>
<h1>What’s Dungeon World Like to Play?</h1>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Playing Dungeon World is all about finding out what happens when your characters encounter dangerous and exciting monsters, strange ruins, and unusual people on their quest for gold and glory. It’s a conversation between the players and the GM—the GM tells the players what they see and hear in the world around them and the players say what their characters are thinking, feeling, and doing. Sometimes those descriptions will trigger a move—something that’ll cause everyone to stop and say “time to roll the dice to see what happens.” For a moment everyone hangs on the edges of their seats as the dice clatter to a stop. Tension and excitement are always the result, no matter how the dice land.</p> 
<p>As you play your characters they’ll change from their adventures and gain experience while learning about the world, overcoming monsters, and gathering riches. You’ll discover how they feel about each other and where their moral compass points them. When they accrue enough experience they’ll gain levels, becoming more powerful and having more options to explore.</p>
<p>You can play Dungeon World with the same group, session to session, over a long series of adventures, watching your characters change and grow together. You can play it as a self-contained game in a single-session, too. Whether a long campaign or a one-shot, Dungeon World’s rules are here to guide you and help you create a world of fantasy adventure. Time to get out there and explore it!</p></Story></Root>
